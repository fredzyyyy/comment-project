I am very proud of your positive growth this semester and it's clear that your study habits have improved since the start of the year. Unfortunately, a semester of positive growth ended on a challenging note. Hopefully you have some insight as to how your preparation methods were different leading up to this most recent assessment. That aside, you should still be tremendously proud of how you’ve pushed yourself this semester. You are capable of the very highest levels of proficiency. You independently succeed and have a diligent work ethic in class. As with every student, despite their grade, I would recommend meeting with me during office hours, even if to just take your understanding of the coursework to the next level through aditional, advanced problems. I am very proud of you Fred and im excited to see where your Calc BC skills take you in the future. I would like you to focus more on the learning and less on the and distracting in class. Not only does it not help others but you will struggle to learn as well, despite how you feel about the material. A goal for you is to work on active listening and self-control in the classroom.
